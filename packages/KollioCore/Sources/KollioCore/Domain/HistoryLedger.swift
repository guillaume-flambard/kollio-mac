/// What a person did to the document, in order, and never edited afterwards.
///
/// ## What this is, and what it is not
///
/// It answers one question that the document cannot: **what happened to this?**
/// The document holds state plus decisions, and a decision preserves a *judgement*
/// somebody made. It does not record that a line was retyped, that a relationship
/// was removed, or that a whole branch was created and then abandoned. So the
/// history of an object is not recoverable from the object.
///
/// It is **not** an event log in the event-sourcing sense, and it is **not** a
/// source of truth:
///
/// - **It is not authoritative.** `KollioDocument` holds the truth. This ledger is
///   derived from the commands a session applied, and a file can arrive without
///   one. Restoring a document from this ledger is not implemented, and no claim
///   is made that it would work.
/// - **It is append-only.** A reversal is recorded as a reversal, never as the
///   removal of what came before. "That was taken back" and "that never happened"
///   are different statements about a person's work, and only the second one
///   erases it.
///
/// Calling it an event log would be the attractive mistake here. The difference is
/// not academic: an event log you can replay is a design commitment, and this one
/// cannot be replayed yet. It is an audit trail with a stated end.
