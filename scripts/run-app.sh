    # Two attempts were made to make it trustworthy and neither worked on this
    # machine. Focusing Kollio first does not hold: another application takes the
    # foreground back within a second or two, and has been observed submitting its
    # own input mid-capture. Cropping to the window's coordinates does not work
    # either, because those are where the window *is*, not what is drawn there.
    # Guarding on the frontmost *process* was tried too and is worse than useless:
    # the check reported Kollio while another application's window was on top, which
    # is precisely the case it was meant to catch.
    #
    # So there is no guard here that would be honest. The file is written, the path
    # is printed, and the reader has to look at it. `docs/known-limitations.md` says
    # the same thing, and the visual evidence for the recent batches rests on the
    # test suites rather than on this picture.
